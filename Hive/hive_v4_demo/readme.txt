Part of Hive ransomware v4 source codes to demonstrate encryption algorithm.

The program hive_v4_demo does the following:
- generates key table and exports it to "*.key.p5rwm" file in current directory;
- encrypts file "test.dat" in the current directory;
- extracts ransom note "wbzc_HOW_TO_DECRYPT.txt" into the current directory.

This program is safe and does not need to be run in VM!
