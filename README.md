# YARA Rules Collection

This repository contains YARA rules for malware research and detection. These rules are intended for security professionals, researchers, and system administrators to help identify potentially malicious software patterns.

## Purpose

- Provide detection capabilities for known malicious software patterns
- Aid in malware analysis and incident response
- Share knowledge with the security research community
- Support defensive security operations

2. Include detailed comments explaining detection logic
3. Add metadata including:
   - Date created
   - Author
   - Description
   - Detection target
   - References to research/analysis
4. Test rules against known samples
5. Avoid false positives by testing against clean files
